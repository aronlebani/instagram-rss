# instagram-rss

Generate an rss feed from your instagram

## Todo

- [ ] Run the scraper every time, but diff the most recent two pkl files so we only add new accounts to the feed
- [ ] Run the scraper headless

## Notes

At this stage it requires [rsshub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub). Pretty sure rsshub is rate limited, so it's probably best to [host it yourself](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/install/).
