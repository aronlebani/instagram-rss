# instagram-rss

Generate an rss feed from your instagram

## Todo

- [ ] Run the scraper headless
- [ ] Cron job to run scraper every X days
- [ ] Cron job to run merger every X hours
- [ ] CLI

## Notes

At this stage it requires [rsshub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub). Pretty sure rsshub is rate limited, so it's probably best to [host it yourself](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/install/).
